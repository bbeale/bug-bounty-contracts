# bug-bounty-contracts

### Phase 0
Basic funcionality for the bug bpunty plataform:

- Posting Contracts
- Posting Bugs
- Making Deposits and Withdraws of DAI
- basic arbitration

### Phase 1

- Add upgrading mechanism(for either small upgrades and big upgrades)
- Allow for multiple tokens, including WETH and others
- Add basic reputation system

### Phase 2 and beyond
here are some ideas that could be implemented in future versions:

- Delegate arbitration to a more complex system(Kleros, for example)
- Meta Transaction to allow for gasless operation(maybe that doesn't make much sense, since is address and balance based)
- Move to a layer 2 solution(Loom for example, to allow for faster and cheaper interactions)
- Move front end to a decentralized system
- Move messagin to a decentralized system
